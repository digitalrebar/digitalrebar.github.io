        "text": "<@UDPV4CC67> to be more descriptive...\nDRP supports either model.  It's more of a style choice depending on how you manage your network traffic and management VLANs.  We see lots of variation so there's no right way.\nIt depends more on your scale, security approach and need to shape traffic on the management network based on provisioning frequency.\n\nDRP can easily scale to handle significant workload (especially if you offload image and repos to dedicated data stores).  On the other hand, the content APIs make it easy to manage distributed endpoints so having a lot of smaller endpoints is not a design problem.\n\nI hope that helps!  and $welcome",
