When I ran the workflow containing the stage, it would basically get stuck on the stage with the missing param, but didn’t seem to log anything and just seemed stuck. Took me an age to track that down… is there any logging I’m missing there, or does it wait silently for a particular reason?",

We'll need to take a look at this scenario and see how we can do better.   I submitted a new issue to track this:\n<https:\/\/github.com\/digitalrebar\/provision\/issues\/1008>",
