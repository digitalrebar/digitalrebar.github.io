NOTE - this is extremely minimally tested (i.e. I chucked it on an arm64 centos7 platform in <http:\/\/packet.net|packet.net> ... and it worked, but YMMV) - please treat it like \"alpha\" feature.  To install - use \"tip\" version, like:\n`curl -s get.rebar.digital\/tip | bash -s -- install --isolated --drp-version=tip`",
