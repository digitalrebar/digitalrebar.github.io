Have always thought that since DRP used Sledgehammer to initially boot new nodes, it could be used to create an inventory of machines and their hardware\/firmware (more useful for those of us using self-owned bare metal.) And after OS installation, have the ability to run an Ansible playbook against the node(s). Or will stuff like this be reserved for \"full-on\" DR?\n\nOn a non-technical note, hope all you folks in TX remain safe with the coming hurricane\/storms, and recover quickly!",
