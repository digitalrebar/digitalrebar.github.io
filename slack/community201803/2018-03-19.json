A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain \"cross-domain\" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.\nCORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether or not it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests. The specification for CORS was originally published as a W3C Recommendation but that document is obsolete. The current actively-maintained specification that defines CORS is the Fetch Living Standard.",
