        "text": "The current issue I’m having is with sledgehammer (I think). One of my (home lab) servers is not bringing networking up properly. \n\nIn attempting to troubleshoot this, some things I noticed:\n\n* the slack archive stops at September 2018\n* I had trouble finding the sledgehammer root password (eventually found it in the `<http:\/\/github.com\/digitalrebar\/sledgehammer|github.com\/digitalrebar\/sledgehammer>` repo)\n* the sledgehammer build doesn’t seem to match what’s in the github repo\n* there’s a comment in the github repo that says it’s unused, but I can’t find the real location. The `sledgehammer-builder` page in the docs says “unspecified” and nothing else. \n* I couldn’t find a way to boot sledgehammer with extra kernel args (I wanted to try `net.ifnames=0` since there was an error in the journal that pointed to an interface naming issue). I ended up hacking it into `kernel-console` in the `global` Profile. \n* the current (1.12.0 &amp; tip) sledgehammer uses version 219 of systemd but `\/etc\/systemd\/network\/20-bootif.network` uses `ClientIdentifier` which was introduced in version 220. \n\nSo far, I’m not sure if any of this has a bearing on why it’s not bringing up networking...\n\nHappy to contribute to the docs, but at the moment I’m feeling a bit green.",
