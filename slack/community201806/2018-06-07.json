We introduced the concepts and directions for our _Net Wrangler_ tool ... and as always, community questions and answers.   On next meetup on June 19th we'll continue with a demo of our Kubernetes HA cluster builds with KRIB-HA, also demo Net Wrangler in operations, and also announce the v3.9.0 enhancements, features, and bug fixes.  We look forward to seeing you there.  Check out the meetup page for all details and RSVP:\n<https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/digitalrebar\/events\/lchdhpyxjbzb\/>",
