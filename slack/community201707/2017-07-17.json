I think I get it now:\n1 - Server gets IP 147.75.90.81 (very small subnet) via DHCP at 147.75.200.3 and asks for PXE (video TC: 4:19)\n2 - DCHP server sends <http:\/\/147.75.200.3\/auto.ipxe> (<http:\/\/packet.net|packet.net> Baremetal boot image i'm guessing)\n3 - (guessing as video refresh hits) auto.ipxe has 'next server' set to what was entered in the iPXE config: <http:\/\/packet.rebar.digital\/default.ipxe>\n4 - Server (PXE proto) looks for <tftp:\/\/147.75.73.23\/147.75.90.81.ipxe> which does not exist... so it uses <http:\/\/packet.rebar.digital\/default.ipxe> to find the next server\n5 - At this point the server does 'goto sledgehammer' which points to  <http:\/\/147.75.73.23:80\/sledgehammer\/b3c09ebd5a9c228c66d8a617b6f5d10ccbe1c273\/vmlinuz0>\n6 - THEN this image and it's control string adjusts the console... and loads the stage1.img of sledgehammer\n7 - I assume now that's the discovery image but it's going to REPORT findings back to 147.75.73.23 ?",
