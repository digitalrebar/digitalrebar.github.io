Generally speaking, you gain the most from the product with deeper integration by use of Workflows to allow you to orchestrate and manage large fleets of systems.  In particular - managing the hardware config - BIOS, Firmware, RAID, setting things like network config \/ bonds, etc ... are all good use cases.  How much you choose to hand off to an external config mgmt tooling varies depending on how much you've invested in that already, versus the desire to use a single tool.",
